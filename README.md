# Java-ColorDrawing-Project

I developed an interface that lets the user fill in rectangles with different colors, with “undo” and “clear” buttons. There are a variety of different colors for the user to pick from in coloring in the different rectangles. If you press the "undo" button after clearing the field, then it brings you back prior to clearing the field. I used a few different listener classes in this project. The ColorListener class was used for setting the color in the rectangles that the user picked in the JComboBox. The PointListener class was for if the user clicked on the rectangles with a mouse. The ButtonListener class was checking if "undo" or "clear" were picked, and the functionality along with it. A CanvasPanel class was used for having the shapes (rectangles) drawn on the project. The left panel contained the buttons and combo box, while the right panel (CanvasPanel) contained the rectangles for the user.
