# Java-ColorDrawing-Project

I developed an interface that lets the user fill in rectangles with different colors, with “undo” and “clear” buttons. There are a variety of different colors for the user to pick from in coloring in the different rectangles. If you press the "undo" button after clearing the field, then it brings you back prior to clearing the field.
